## Inspiration and Differences üí°

This project is inspired by [CS50W Project 1](https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/1/project1.html).

**Main differences:**

* The original project requires using Heroku for the database and the Goodreads API for external ratings.
* This version uses Render.com for the database and the Google Books API, because **an earlier version of the original project required exactly those services** (Render and Google Books). Therefore, the differences are minimal and only affect minor integration and presentation details.

## Description üìù

This project is a web application for searching books, viewing details, posting reviews, and managing users. It uses Flask, SQLAlchemy, and the Google Books API. You can use a PostgreSQL database (recommended for production) or SQLite (easier for local testing).

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

* `application.py`: Main Flask application logic
* `database.py`: Database models and configuration
* `import.py`: Script to import books from CSV (must be run manually to load initial data)
* `drop_all.py`: Script to drop all tables
* `static/`: Static assets (CSS, images, JS)
* `templates/`: Jinja2 HTML templates
* `books.csv`: Sample book data
* `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

---

## Prerequisites ‚öôÔ∏è

* Python 3.x
* pip
* (Optional) An account on [Render.com](https://render.com/) for a free PostgreSQL database

---

## 1. Create and activate a virtual environment üêç

```powershell
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 2. Install dependencies üì¶

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask_wtf
```

---

## 3. Configure environment variables üîë

### Option A: Use SQLite (easier for local testing)

No need to set `DATABASE_URL`. The project can be configured to use SQLite by editing `application.py`:

```python
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///books.db"
```

### Option B: Use PostgreSQL on Render.com

1. Create an account at [Render.com](https://render.com/)
2. Go to "Dashboard" > "New" > "PostgreSQL"
3. Name your database and create the service
4. Copy the connection URL (format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`)
5. In your terminal, set the environment variable:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "<your_connection_url>"
```

---

## 4. Other required environment variables üß©

```powershell
$env:API_KEY = "<your_google_books_api_key>"
$env:FLASK_APP = "application.py"
$env:SECRETKEY = "secretkey"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG = 1
```

---

## 5. Run the application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```powershell
flask run
```

Or:

```powershell
python application.py
```

---

## 6. First-time setup üö¶

* If the database is empty, **you must manually run** the `import.py` script to load data from `books.csv`:

```powershell
python import.py
```

* You can register a new account through the web interface.
* Searches can be performed by ISBN, title, or author.
* Only one review is allowed per book and it cannot be edited.
